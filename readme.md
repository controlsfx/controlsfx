ControlsFX
=====

ControlsFX is an open source project for JavaFX that aims to provide really high quality UI controls and other tools to complement the core JavaFX distribution. It has been developed for JavaFX 8.0 and beyond, and has a guiding principle of only accepting new controls / features when all existing code is at an acceptably high level, including thankless jobs like having [high quality javadoc documentation](http://docs.controlsfx.org). This ensure a high quality release is available at all times, with all experimental work being done in branches of the main code base.

## Features

## Getting Started

If you **want to play** with the ControlsFX sample application, simply download the ControlsFX release and run the following command on the command prompt (be sure to replace the * with the actual version number of FXSampler and ControlsFX-samples):

`java -jar controlsfx-samples-*.jar`

If you think you have a feature **you can contribute**, a bug you want to fix, or have a bug you'd like to file, please direct it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

If you **want to use** ControlsFX, then you're probably wondering how to use the API that we've slaved over for hours! In your case, the best and definitive location for help is definitely [our javadocs](http://docs.controlsfx.org). Fear not, these are not a barren wasteland of undescribed functionality - we've poured our hearts into making these javadocs full to the brim of examples, commentary and explanation. If anything is unclear to you, [file a bug in our issue tracker](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and we'll do our best to update the documentation straight away!

If you **have questions**, you should join the the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/controlsfx-dev).

Another great place to explore is our **sample code**, all located in the controlsfx-samples directory of this source code repository. We've put a bunch of effort into making these examples something you can learn from.
